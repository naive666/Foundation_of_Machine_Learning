    "- **What is the Likelihood Function?**  \n",
    "  - The likelihood is a function of the parameters of a statistical model. Given some results of an observation, we estimate the parameters. \n",
    "  - Suppose we have a probability function: $P(x|\\theta)$, if $\\theta$ is known and fixed, x is the variable, then we say $P(x|\\theta)$ probability function. If $x$ is known and fixed, which means we know the result of the observation, and we would like to know about $\\theta$, we say $L(\\theta|x)$ likelihood function.\n",
    "  - For example, we now have an unfair coin, and we don't know either the probability of $P(head)$ or $P(tail)$, but we can flip the coins for several times, here we flip 2 times. Then we get the result---suppose we get 2 Heads. Let's denote $P(head) = \\theta$, then the likelihood $L(\\theta|HH) = P(HH|\\theta) = \\theta^2$, if the reuslt is $HHT$, then $L(\\theta|HHT) = \\theta^2(1-\\theta)$\n",
    "  - How can we choose the **\"Best Parameter\"** based on our experiment?  \n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "- **The Maximum Likelihood (ML) Estimator**\n",
    "  - We should choose a parameter that maximize the prbability of the outcomes\n",
    "  - $\\hat{\\theta} = \\arg\\max_{\\theta}P(x|\\theta)$\n",
    "  - In the above situation, if the result is $HHT$, $L(\\theta|HHT) = P(HHT|\\theta) = \\theta^2(1-\\theta)$, when $\\theta = \\frac{2}{3}$, we have the maximum likelihood. However, if the result is $HH$, then $L(\\theta|HH) = P(HH|\\theta) = \\theta^2$, we choose $\\theta = 1$ as the estimator, since $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 1$, but this seems implausible.\n"

    "- **Priori and Posteriori**  \n",
    "The **prior probability** $p(y)$ is the probability of the state before we have observed it. For example, we usually beleive a coin is fair, which means $P(head) = P(tail) = 0.5$, but in some cases, this is not the truth, and therefore we need to revise our estimator based on the experiment outcomes.The revised estimator is **Posteriori Estimator**.\n",

    "Suppose for a particular event, our intuition tells us the probablity of happen is $P(happen)$ (\"happen\" in this case is like parameter), and after some new external information comes(\"Information\" is like the outcome of observation), the revised probability of \"happen\" becomes $P(happen | information)$. In this case, we find $P(information | happen) = L(happen | inforamtion)$ is the Likelihood Function. If we combine the **Likelihood and Prior probability** and apply **Bayesian Rule**, we get: $$P(happen | information) = \\frac{P(information | happen)P(happen)}{p(information)}$$\n",
