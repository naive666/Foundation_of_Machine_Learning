## Introduction
This is a very famous machine learning project origining from the master course [DS-GA 103](https://davidrosenberg.github.io/ml2019/#home)(Machine Learning) of NYU. The CTO of Bloomberg, David Rosenberg, an experienced Machine Learning expert, takes in charge of delivering this course.  

Bloomberg presents "Foundations of Machine Learning," a training course that was initially delivered internally to the company's software engineers as part of its "Machine Learning EDU" initiative. This course covers a wide variety of topics in machine learning and statistical modeling. The primary goal of the class is to help participants gain a deep understanding of the concepts, techniques and mathematical frameworks used by experts in machine learning. It is designed to make valuable machine learning skills more accessible to individuals with a strong math background, including software developers, experimental scientists, engineers and financial professionals. 

The purpose of this Github Project is to record my learning and show my solution to the homework at the meantime.  

You can check more details of the course from the [Bloomberg webpage](https://bloomberg.github.io/foml/#home), and download any required resource.
